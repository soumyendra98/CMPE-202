PROBLEM STATEMENT

Create a UML class diagram for a system maintaining information about a fragment of the airline industry. When creating the diagram, you should consider the following information: (15 points)

A flight is operated by an airline.
A flight is identified by its number;
A flight departs and arrives at two airports, at specific departure and arrival date and time, respectively.
A flight is piloted by the first and the second pilots, who are employed by an airline operating a flight.
An airport is identified by its airport code (e.g., ATL for the Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport) and is located in a city.
A flight involves an airplane, which is sometimes referred to as the flight’s equipment.
Furthermore, each airplane has a number of seats, each designated by a row number and a seat's position within the row (a single letter code), for example, 14B.
A passenger occupies a seat on a flight.  Consider this last bit of information about a passenger occupying a seat carefully, as a passenger involves both a seat and a flight.
Your diagram should closely model the information described above. You should identify the necessary classes and decide what types of relationships should be used to connect the classes to closely model the provided information. You may add more classes and relationships of your choice, if you think they may be useful.

Also, you must provide suitable attributes and operations. Specify multiplicities where needed.

Use Astah tool or any other drawing tool to create the class diagram.

Output file: JPG and PNG formats are acceptable. Also PDF is acceptable.

Write Java declarations for the classes (5 points)
